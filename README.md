# Features

-> The initial page will be a video on loop they will send later on (added a youtube video just to see how it's going to look)
-> We need to make the whole website responsive;
-> the Navbar starts after the video and it's grabbed once we scroll pass it;
-> We need to align the background images to make them behave in the same way and keep them align (the way it is on the image)
-> We need to add the desing on the last page (the same we have in the design_reference)
-> Make sure the footer is the same;
-> Add page for each clickable link (each Expertise topic and each "Our Work" )
-> Add the Manifesto video (It will be provided later so let's just add a youtube video same as the home page)
->
